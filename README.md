  <h1>iOSToAndroidRes</h1>
  <p>iOSToAndroidRes is a project that takes iOS resolution-based files and copies them to the corresponding resolution files in an Android application's resource directory.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use this project, you must provide a source directory containing exactly 3 files named in the following pattern: "<..>_1x", "<..>_2x", and "<..>_3x". These files must be named according to the iOS resolutions.</p>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Make sure to use the correct file naming pattern, as the script relies on it to properly copy the files to the target directory.</p>
